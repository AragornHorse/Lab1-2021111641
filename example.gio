Say , Jim , how about going for a few beers after dinner ? __eou__ You know that is tempting but is really not good for our fitness . __eou__ What do you mean ? It will help us to relax . __eou__ Do you really think so ? I don't . It will just make us fat and act silly . Remember last time ? __eou__ I guess you are right.But what shall we do ? I don't feel like sitting at home . __eou__ I suggest a walk over to the gym where we can play singsong and meet some of our friends . __eou__ That's a good idea . I hear Mary and Sally often go there to play pingpong.Perhaps we can make a foursome with them . __eou__ Sounds great to me ! If they are willing , we could ask them to go dancing with us.That is excellent exercise and fun , too . __eou__ Good.Let ' s go now . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Can you do push-ups ? __eou__ Of course I can . It's a piece of cake ! Believe it or not , I can do 30 push-ups a minute . __eou__ Really ? I think that's impossible ! __eou__ You mean 30 push-ups ? __eou__ Yeah ! __eou__ It's easy . If you do exercise everyday , you can make it , too . __eou__
Can you study with the radio on ? __eou__ No , I listen to background music . __eou__ What is the difference ? __eou__ The radio has too many comerials . __eou__ That's true , but then you have to buy a record player . __eou__
Are you all right ? __eou__ I will be all right soon . I like cooking very much . I like eating very much. I like dinner very much.
